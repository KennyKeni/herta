Entralink (/warp lab[1 through 6]) http://wiki.cobblemondelta.com/entralink (Currently Genesect Head, Torso and Legs are the only mythical currently possible from dowsing.) Step 3 While Holding the machine (NEEDS TO BE YOUR MAIN HAND), move around until a bar appears on the top of your screen, now go in the direction which fills the bar to almost full with only two “!!”. Riding a Pokémon can make this easier. When you are at two !! with a green bar an area of green particles should appear, if walked over you will gain the rewards."

These can contain various food items like meat, melons, apples, golden apples and golden carrots, rare candy, some custom weapons and more. However, sometimes these can be chest form Gimmighouls in disguise. This will initiate a battle with a low level Gimmighoul. If you do not have a non-fainted pokémon, it becomes aggressive and will attack the player in regular PvE combat. As soon as the disguise falls, it is counted towards the task; defeating it is not necessary. Evolving Gimmighoul requires 999 Relic Coins. These can be obtained easily by running away from Gimmighouls until the battle ends (/endbattle doesn't work in dungeons), then killing them through regular Minecraft PvE. Puzzle chests, chests found at the end of parkour, puzzles or mazes, can never be Gimmighouls. These Puzzle chests will often include rarer items like fossils, netherite, diamonds and armor trims."
